# Baker-Matthews Image Alignment in C++, with speed and accuracy optimisations

This C++ application aims to implement the Baker-Matthews inverse compositional image alignment algorithm, with a robust M-estimator to add robustness against lighting conditions.

This C++ implementation is an adaption of Assignment 7 of Carnegie Mellon University's [http://16-385 Computer Vision course](http://16385.courses.cs.cmu.edu/fall2020) in Fall 2020. It is a great course: I advise CMU students to take it if possible. Lecture slides from which this implementation is derived can be  found publicly on the [course website](http://16385.courses.cs.cmu.edu/fall2020/lecture/track)
